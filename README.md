# Gomoku-2players-boardGameLab
Gomoku, also called Gobang or Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board, using 19Ã—19 grid intersections.
Players alternate turns placing the 'stone' of their color on the empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.The program will terminate once the winner occur.
